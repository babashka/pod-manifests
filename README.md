## Registering a pod

To register a pod, create a nested directory in `manifests` with the following structure:

```
<org>/<pod-name>/<version>
```

and add a `manifest.edn` file like the following example:

``` clojure
{:pod/name tzzh/mail
 :pod/description ""
 :pod/version "0.0.2"
 :pod/license ""
 :pod/artifacts
 [{:os/name "Linux.*"
   :os/arch "amd64"
   :artifact/url "https://github.com/tzzh/pod-tzzh-mail/releases/download/v0.0.2/pod-tzzh-mail_0.0.2_Linux_x86_64.zip"
   :artifact/executable "pod-tzzh-mail"}
  {:os/name "Mac.*"
   :os/arch "x86_64"
   :artifact/url "https://github.com/tzzh/pod-tzzh-mail/releases/download/v0.0.2/pod-tzzh-mail_0.0.2_Darwin_x86_64.zip"
   :artifact/executable "pod-tzzh-mail"}
  {:os/name "Windows.*"
   :os/arch "amd64"
   :artifact/url "https://github.com/tzzh/pod-tzzh-mail/releases/download/v0.0.2/pod-tzzh-mail_0.0.2_Windows_x86_64.zip"
   :artifact/executable "pod-tzzh-mail.exe"}]}
```

The required fields are `:pod/name`, `:pod/version` and `:pod/artifacts`.

You can then load the pod in your babashka script as follows:

```
(require '[babashka.pods :as pods])
(pods/load-pod 'tzzh/mail "0.0.2")

(require '[pod.tzzh.mail :as m])
(m/send-mail ...)
```


The `:pod/artifacts` vector will be matched in order on operating system and
architecture. For the first match, the `:articact/url`, a zip file, will be
downloaded and extracted. After extraction there should be a file with the same
name as `:artifact/executable` which will be made executable and invoked as the
pod.
